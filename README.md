- **core**: Modules to help you build core stuff, such as creating classes in an OOP way, adding to such classes a `obj.get('propName')` and `obj.set('propName', value)` behavior, building a boolean expression, etc.
- **css**: Module to help you inject CSS in your application. It is best used with dojo toolkit's builder.
- **lib**: CLI module for Node.js
- **modules**: Tools to help you create NineJS modules and some pre-made modules too.
- **nineplate**: turns XML templates (HTML too) into javascript functions that render either DOM nodes or text based on a parameter context. Can be optimized in a Dojo Build.
